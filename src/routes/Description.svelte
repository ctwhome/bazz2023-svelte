    An event that aims to bridge dance communities like Swing, Street dance and Afro, and to explore
    how these communities can fuel and inspire each other. Let's cross the borders between dance
    styles, while honoring their evolution, similarities and differences. Let's be Bad Ass and
    explore what we can learn from each other and celebrate the richness of Afrocentric body
    movement and language.
