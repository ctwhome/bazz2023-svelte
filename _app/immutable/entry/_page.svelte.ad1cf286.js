BAZZ Lab is focused on a crossover between two different dance styles. One Jazz teacher, and one teacher of another dance style will be guiding these sessions together. Let's explore existing links between Jazz and its contemporary descendant dance styles, let's celebrate their similarities and differences! (Included in all class passes)

JAZZ Hub session is totally focused on Jazz! In this session we will bring all our badass Jazz teachers together in the same room to share their diverse perspectives on many motives that create a Jazz landscape. With a goal to help you find your own truth within a Jazz universe, we will tackle topics like groove, improvisation, authenticity, culture, jamming etc. If you're wondering how this will look like, probably more like a party rather than a class ;)
(NOT included in any pass, you can sign up separately in registration form)

BAZZ Buzz is focused on YOU!
